# BOOKest-App
The bookworm app 

https://carlashub.github.io/BOOKest-App/
This project is a sketch of an app I intend to develop in the future for bookaholics out there.:) 
So far I would like /have to add: 
-	Add a keep track feature with alerts and messages for the user 
-	Browse and add titles  feature 
-	“Reading goal” feature with check list 
-	Previous  challenges, present and future
-	Badges earned “bookworm, bibliophile” and so on
-	-Add different list categories 
-	Move titles from lists to others
-	Books categories by gender and sub-gender 
-	Personal notes: a space to save quotes, paragraphs or even chapters 
-	Community: where you can see what people are reading and other  people  lists and even maybe see what people are reading on the neighbourhood 
-	Labels feature – every title must have its own labels 
-	Readers online 
-	Picture of the author near to the title
-	Auto-completion 
-	Are you sure you want to delete? 
-	And much more
